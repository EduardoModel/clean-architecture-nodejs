# Clean architecture with Nodejs

This project is focused on the learning and understanding of the clean architecture applied to NodeJs.

This project uses TDD and Typescript.

Another cool feature is the use of the library called [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). It allows the use of Hooks with git to ensure some properties of the code, like a style guide and the approval of all test suites.
